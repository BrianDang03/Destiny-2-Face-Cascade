## Overview
This project aims to detect the face of my Destiny 2 character in video frames, allowing me to explore the capabilities of OpenCV in a fun and engaging way. I created a custom Haar Cascade for face detection, using a third-party application to generate the cascade model. For training, I provided both positive and negative samples, automating data preparation by converting all sample images to grayscale and resizing the positive samples to improve accuracy during training. The custom Haar Cascade scans each video frame to identify the character's face.
